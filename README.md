#  Restaurant Table Booking System

The Restaurant Table Booking System allows users to reserve tables by selecting a date, time, number of persons, and available table number. The system prevents double booking by checking existing reservations in Firebase Firestore.
## Flask + Firebase Firestore
An admin panel is provided to view all bookings, update booking status (booked, completed, cancelled), and delete bookings when needed. Authentication for admin access is handled securely using session-based login and environment variables.
